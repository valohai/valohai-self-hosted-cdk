# Valohai Self-Hosted CDK Tempalte

This template allows you provision AWS resources for a self-hosted Valohai installation.

To deploy:
1. Follow the steps below to activate the virtual environment and install requirements.
2. Review the `cdk.json` file for configuration options (VPC, subnet, tags, etc.)

Use the following step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation
